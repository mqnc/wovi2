kitchen scene, single thread, sampling:
4861 checks in 3.2 seconds
built for sweeping tho, lots of overhead (hierarchical, recreate world, ...)
~1500/s
* 8 threads * maybe 2 without overhead = 24k
~30*30*30 Raster pro sekunde
looks good!

tried Easy3D for 3d visualization since it is the only small thing I could find that supports depth peeling. Played a bit with it, not well documented, didn't manage to change mesh color,
https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D/issues/219

downloaded and built VTK (also supports depth peeling), MASSIVE, didn't want to look into it.

the thing is, visualizing through the browser is probably not the most elegant but I just have a ton of experience with three.js and it's very well documented, I will probably be the quickest with that. Let's hope data transmission is fast enough for marching cubes rendering
update: looks good!

stepped into a trap into which I keep stepping:
uWebSockets is supposedly "header only" but has dependencies sans fin and sucks to build.
CivetWeb is what I want. Needs a single c file + optional c++ binding file, http and ws on the same port.

was considering to create a super generic js remote control bridge from c++ which would be much more powerful than meshcat, but then again why would I want to do stuff in c++ that I could do from js which is much simpler.
Then I was considering to use meshcat but I want depth peeling and it's probably also faster to update the marching cubes mesh by transfering a float32array directly as binary through the ws



sometimes somehow not responsive...
